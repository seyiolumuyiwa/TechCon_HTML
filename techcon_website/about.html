      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>SRC TECHCON, the flagship conference of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) founded in 1982, has evolved from a platform to showcase SRC-funded university research into a pivotal annual event held in Austin, Texas, fostering collaboration between academia and industry, highlighting student-led innovations in microelectronics, and serving as a major recruiting hub through its CareerConnections component. With a rigorous 30% acceptance rate for student presentations, a growing focus on diversity (over 50% participation from women and underrepresented minorities in 2024), and an expanding scope covering topics like AI-driven design and sustainable computing, TECHCON remains a vital nexus for advancing semiconductor research and cultivating the next generation of industry talent.
